## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?\
For this project, the goal is to create an interactive coloring game in Python that lets users choose a graphic and color it using a palette of colors. The game will use Python’s tkinter library, which provides easy-to-use tools for creating graphical interfaces, including buttons, color pickers, and canvas elements for drawing. The game will display a selection of simple, line-drawn graphics (such as animals, landscapes, or geometric shapes), allowing the user to pick one to color. The selected graphic will be displayed on a canvas, and users can click on various regions within it to apply their chosen colors.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome for this project will include:

-A working interface where users can select a graphic and color palette.
-Interactive functionality that allows users to click on sections of the graphic to apply colors.
-The ability to reset the graphic to its original uncolored state.
-Basic save functionality to export the completed artwork as an image file.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A better outcome for this project would include:
-expanded library of graphics for users to choose from.
-enhanced color selection system, such as a full color picker allowing for custom color choices.
-undo feature to revert the last coloring action.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline
A best outcome for this project would include:

-diverse library of complex graphics with clearly defined, clickable coloring regions.
- advanced color picker with customizable palettes and the ability to save favorite colors.
-Multiple undo and redo options, as well as a history slider for reviewing color changes.
-A save function that allows users to export their artwork in high resolution with optional frame or background templates.
-A user-friendly interface with tooltips and interactive tutorials for new users.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
The next steps for this project will involve several key stages, each with its own learning requirements. First, I’ll need to expand my knowledge of tkinter, specifically focusing on using the canvas element effectively for interactive image handling. Understanding how to load and map regions within graphics as I’ll need to identify individual regions as separate clickable areas for color application. This may involve exploring libraries like Pillow.

Beyond basic interactivity, I’ll need to research event handling in tkinter to manage clicks, color selection, and undo/redo functionality. Adding features like a custom color picker will require a deeper understanding of RGB and HEX color models and possibly some basic color theory if I want to guide users toward harmonious color choices. Additionally, for the save and export features, I’ll need to learn more about file handling in Python, specifically in saving canvases as image files. Exporting in high resolution may require working with different image formats and file-handling techniques to ensure quality.

To create a more polished, user-friendly experience, I’ll research interface design and explore ways to add animations and visual feedback to make the app feel interactive and responsive. This may involve studying basic animation principles in tkinter or implementing audio feedback through libraries like pygame to enhance user engagement. Lastly, if I aim to create a color history or advanced undo functionality, understanding data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating color states. Overall, my next steps involve building on existing Python skills with more advanced GUI programming, image processing, and user interface design.

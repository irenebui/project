# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to do an art inspired project. I can use turtle and random to generate simple shapes and colors to create different drawings at command. Or I was thinking of doing something like import a picture and have the picture come up not filled in with color and then fill the color when you click on the area. Or something like that.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I plan on doing this by myself.
